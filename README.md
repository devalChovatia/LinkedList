This project dives into the world of LinkedLists

The purpose of this program is to add two polynomials together and print
out the answer. The polynomial expressions consist of single term coefficients,
exponents and a variable x.

The use of LinkedList and StringBuilder is used heavily throughout the program to
convert LinkedList<Term> to String and vice versa.
